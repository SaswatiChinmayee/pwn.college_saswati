# Command History
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!


## Solution:
 When we use the up and down arrow keys we can access our previous commands. Thus i used my up key till i found the flag.

```

hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{4QCiJZSx5b1ufoVmSUQ1XnaCgkT.0lNzEzNxwSOxQzNzEzW}
bash: the: command not found
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ 
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{4QCiJZSx5b1ufoVmSUQ1XnaCgkT.0lNzEzNxwSOxQzNzEzW}
```
